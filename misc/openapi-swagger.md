Not important but I always forget this... might as well jot it down here.

# OpenAPI
It is a `specification`, based on the `Swagger Specification`, donated by SmartBear software.

More on the specification can be found [here](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html). Basically a set of rules you have to follow if you want to describe your API in the "Open API way".

# Swagger
Swagger is the name associated with some of the most well-known, and widely used tools for implementing the OpenAPI specification. The Swagger toolset includes:
- swagger editor: lets you edit OpenAPI specifications in YAML inside your browser and to preview documentations in real time.
- swagger ui: a collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from an OAS-compliant API.
- and many more...
