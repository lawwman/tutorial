- Can view simple guides, but I feel they are not very informative if you want very detailed stuff.
- I feel that this [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb3Qk8SG5Ms&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU&index=2) is actually better than reading the docs. Should watch this first, THEN read the docs.
